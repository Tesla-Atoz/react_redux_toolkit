for internship at mithya labs, i need to have
1. react core concepts
2. react-redux
3. react-router

approaching using bottom-up :

1. I have completed react-router mose basic use cases examples in its project.
2. Then started learning redux core concepts and understood its architecture. I have written entire conceptual things in their
repective files. go through them.
Note : I need to complete redux's other lectures from udemy course. once recap what i have written and resume them.

react internal concepts I need to start after learning redux completely.

Maybe i would be resuming my learning after exams. so, completed half the work now itself for more faster pace later.

Dear futureself., I love u.

I love u dp. not me. I mean her. dp.

REJOICE.
22:19 finished writing this.
